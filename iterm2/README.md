# iTerm2 configuration

`com.googlecode.iterm2.plist` can be exported from iTerm2 Preferences via General → Preferences, ensuring "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL" is ticked, browsing to save out preferences to this repository's location on disk, and persisting changes when your preferences change.

A collection of colours which can be imported into an iTerm profile are known as "Colour Presets" and can be exported/imported as an `itermcolors` file (seen in this directory as `lukeify.itermcolors`).

An entire iTerm Profile can be composed of these presets and other appearance values, and is stored in the `lukeify-iterm.json` file which can likewise be exported/imported from the bottom right of the profile tableview within iTerm 2 Preferences → Profiles.
